--draw circle at x,y with radius and segments segments. few segments can draw triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. Rotate expects radians, so you can rotate shapes
function circle(x,y,radius,segments,rotate)
	rotate = rotate or 0
	segment = pi2/segments
	for i = 1,segments do
		screen.drawLine(cos(segment*i+rotate)*radius+x,sin(segment*i+rotate)*radius+y,cos(segment*((i-1)%segments)+rotate)*radius+x,sin(segment*((i-1)%segments)+rotate)*radius+y)
	end
end
